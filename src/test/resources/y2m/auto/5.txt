"pl-302","Maven Plugins","","Merge explicit <dependency> and filtered dependencies","Evgeny Goldin","Friday, February 11, 2011 2:10:24 AM IST","Friday, October 21, 2011 1:41:12 AM IST","Sunday, October 2, 2011 4:59:03 AM IST","Normal","Feature","Fixed","evgenyg","maven-copy-plugin","0.2.3.4","No Affected versions","588","Previously, when specifying resource *{{<dependency>}}* there were two ways to do so:

* Explicit *{{<dependency>}}* using {{<groupId>}} and {{<artifactId>}}.
* Filtered *{{<dependency>}}* using {{<includeScope>}}, {{<excludeTransitive>}}, {{<includeGroupIds>}} and [http://evgeny-goldin.com/wiki/Maven-copy-plugin#.3Cdependency.3E_reference other tags].

It was not possible to merge the two, one either had to go explicit with a single dependency or filter ''all'' project dependencies. It is now possible to mix both options:

*1* - Bring a specific *{{<dependency>}}* and all its transitive dependencies:

{code}
<dependency>
    <groupId> .. </groupId>
    <artifactId> .. </artifactId>
    <version> .. </version>
    <excludeTransitive>false</excludeTransitive>
</dependency>
{code}
*2* - Bring a specific *{{<dependency>}}* and all its transitive dependencies, filtered on some condition:

{code}
<dependency>
    <groupId> .. </groupId>
    <artifactId> .. </artifactId>
    <version> .. </version>
    <excludeTransitive>false</excludeTransitive>
    <includeGroupIds> .. </includeGroupIds>
    <includeClassifiers> .. </includeClassifiers>
